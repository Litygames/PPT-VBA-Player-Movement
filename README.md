# What is the `InputPlayer.bas` module?

This is the module imported by my [PPT Game Maker](https://litygames.itch.io/ppt-game-maker/) add-in to handle player movement and logic for collisions and interactions with the environment.

[PowerPoint Game Maker](https://litygames.itch.io/ppt-game-maker/) is an add-in that allows you to create keyboard-controlled video games in Microsoft PowerPoint, without the need for programming.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are using [PPT Game Maker](https://litygames.itch.io/ppt-game-maker/), modifying the `InputPlayer.bas` module may affect the functionality of the add-in.

## Requirements

- [PPT Game Maker](https://litygames.itch.io/ppt-game-maker/) add-in installed.
- Microsoft PowerPoint 2016 or later, version 16.0, build 17932 or higher.

## Installation

To integrate this module into your PowerPoint project, follow these steps:

1. Install my add-in [PPT Game Maker](https://litygames.itch.io/ppt-game-maker/) from itch.io.

> I recommend watching my [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/UeXCiiFa0X4?si=F5K0Mg0lmSk44MC3) for a detailed guide on installing the add-in and using it.

2. In the add-in tab, click `Configure Presentation` > `Add Player`.

This will automatically create and import the `InputPlayer.bas` module into your project.
